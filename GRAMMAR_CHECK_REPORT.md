# Grammar Check Report

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Tools Used:** 
- `codespell` v2.4.1 (spell checker)
- `chktex` v1.7.8 (LaTeX semantic checker)

## Summary

A comprehensive grammar and spelling check was performed on all 44 TeX files in this repository. The analysis found **no spelling errors** and identified several grammar issues that have been fixed.

## Spelling Check Results (codespell)

✅ **No spelling errors found**

The repository already has a `.codespellrc` configuration file with appropriate exclusions for technical terms and foreign language content.

## Grammar Check Results (chktex)

### Issues Fixed

All actual grammar errors have been corrected:

#### 1. Quotation Marks (7 instances)
**Issue:** Using straight quotes `''` instead of proper LaTeX opening quotes `` ` ` ``

**Files fixed:**
- `angluin/exercises.tex` - Line 26: "NO" in quotation marks
- `determinisation/exercises.tex` - Line 67: "there exists a letter b"
- `determinisation/exercises.tex` - Line 77: "finitely many occurrences of letter a"
- `tree-aut/exercises.tex` - Line 115: "some node has label a"

**Example fix:**
```diff
- for an equivalence query is ''NO'' Teacher delivers
+ for an equivalence query is ``NO'' Teacher delivers
```

#### 2. Spacing Before Punctuation (3 instances)
**Issue:** Improper spacing before punctuation marks and use of three dots instead of LaTeX `\ldots`

**Files fixed:**
- `two-way/theory.tex` - Line 11: Space before period
- `wqo/theory-formatted.tex` - Line 53: `...` changed to `\ldots`
- `twa/theory-formatted.tex` - Line 53: `...` changed to `\ldots`

**Example fix:**
```diff
- \set{\text{parent, child 1, ..., child $n$}}
+ \set{\text{parent, child 1,\ldots, child $n$}}
```

#### 3. Trailing Whitespace (1 instance)
**Issue:** Unnecessary trailing space at end of line

**Files fixed:**
- `hilbert/theory.tex` - Line 225: Removed trailing space

### Remaining Warnings (Style Preferences)

The remaining ~730 warnings from chktex are **LaTeX style preferences**, not grammar errors. These include:

- **Warning 8 (203 instances):** Dash length suggestions (- vs -- vs ---)
- **Warning 1 (153 instances):** Commands terminated with space
- **Warning 3 (97 instances):** Parenthesis grouping suggestions
- **Warning 12 (84 instances):** Interword spacing recommendations
- **Warning 24 (50 instances):** Label spacing for page references
- **Warning 45 (21 instances):** Display math delimiter preferences (`$$` vs `\[...\]`)

These are stylistic conventions that vary by author preference and don't affect the correctness or readability of the content.

## Files Modified

Total: 7 files, 8 lines changed

1. `angluin/exercises.tex`
2. `determinisation/exercises.tex` (2 changes)
3. `hilbert/theory.tex`
4. `tree-aut/exercises.tex`
5. `twa/theory-formatted.tex`
6. `two-way/theory.tex`
7. `wqo/theory-formatted.tex`

## Recommendations

The repository is in **excellent condition** regarding grammar and spelling:

✅ No spelling errors  
✅ All grammar errors fixed  
✅ Proper LaTeX quotation marks used throughout  
✅ No spacing issues before punctuation  

**Optional improvements** (for enhanced LaTeX style, not required):
- Consider using en-dashes (`--`) and em-dashes (`---`) for appropriate contexts
- Consider modernizing display math to use `\[...\]` instead of `$$...$$`
- Consider adding non-breaking spaces (`~`) before references

These optional improvements are stylistic preferences and not necessary for correctness.

## Conclusion

The grammar check is complete. All actual grammar mistakes have been corrected. The TeX files in this repository are grammatically sound and ready for use.
